# Frontend Fixes Requirements Document

## Introduction

The MCP Ecosystem Platform frontend has compilation errors that prevent it from running properly. This spec addresses the systematic resolution of these issues to get the React frontend operational and properly integrated with the FastAPI backend.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Resolve Missing Dependencies

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all required dependencies to be properly installed so that the frontend can compile without module resolution errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend build process runs THEN all @mui/lab dependencies SHALL be resolved
2. WHEN the frontend build process runs THEN all @mui/material/icons dependencies SHALL be resolved  
3. WHEN the frontend build process runs THEN all missing TypeScript type definitions SHALL be available
4. WHEN npm start is executed THEN no "Cannot find module" errors SHALL occur

### Requirement 2: Fix API Client Implementation

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want a properly implemented API client so that the frontend can communicate with the backend services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the APIClient class is instantiated THEN it SHALL have get, post, put, and delete methods
2. WHEN API methods are called THEN they SHALL properly handle authentication and error responses
3. WHEN API calls are made THEN they SHALL use the correct base URL and endpoint paths
4. WHEN API responses are received THEN they SHALL be properly typed with TypeScript interfaces

### Requirement 3: Resolve TypeScript Compilation Errors

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the TypeScript code to compile without errors so that the application can run in development and production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TypeScript compilation runs THEN no strict mode violations SHALL occur
2. WHEN function parameters are used THEN they SHALL have proper type annotations
3. WHEN reserved keywords are used as parameter names THEN they SHALL be renamed to valid identifiers
4. WHEN components are referenced THEN they SHALL be properly imported and defined

### Requirement 4: Fix Component Import Issues

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want all React components to be properly imported and available so that the UI renders correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components are imported THEN all required dependencies SHALL be available
2. WHEN MUI components are used THEN they SHALL be imported from the correct packages
3. WHEN custom components are referenced THEN they SHALL exist and be properly exported
4. WHEN SWR hooks are used THEN the useSWR function SHALL be properly imported

### Requirement 5: Establish Proper Backend Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want the frontend to successfully connect to the backend API so that I can interact with MCP servers and workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend loads THEN it SHALL successfully connect to the backend at the correct URL
2. WHEN API calls are made THEN they SHALL use the proper /api/v1 prefix
3. WHEN authentication is required THEN it SHALL be properly handled
4. WHEN CORS issues occur THEN they SHALL be resolved through proper configuration

### Requirement 6: Ensure Development Environment Stability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a stable development environment so that I can work on features without constant compilation errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN npm start is executed THEN the development server SHALL start without errors
2. WHEN code changes are made THEN hot reloading SHALL work properly
3. WHEN the browser loads the application THEN no console errors SHALL appear
4. WHEN the application runs THEN all core functionality SHALL be accessible
